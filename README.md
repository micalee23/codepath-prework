## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

## Notes
I encountered difficulties while getting familiar with the different aspects of Xcode â€“ understanding how everything worked took some time. When I moved my repository to GitHub, I also had trouble uploading my work using Xcode's Source Control center. Fortunately, I found a video that guided me through the process and helped me overcome the challenge. Additionally, I had some trouble using Kap and Giphy to create a valid URL from my GIF, but I managed to troubleshoot and solve the problem.

#### App Idea 
Local Sustainable Living Map 
This mobile application would be designed to help users adopt and engage in environmentally friendly and sustainable practices within their local communities.

There would be an interactive map that displays various sustainable living points of interest in the user's local area such as farmers market, recycling centers and public transportation stops. There would also be a sustainable tips and resources section with educational content such as articles, videos and guides on topics such as sustainable fashion.
