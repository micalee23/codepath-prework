## Notes
I encountered difficulties while getting familiar with the different aspects of Xcode â€“ understanding how everything worked took some time. When I moved my repository to GitHub, I also had trouble uploading my work using Xcode's Source Control center. Fortunately, I found a video that guided me through the process and helped me overcome the challenge.
